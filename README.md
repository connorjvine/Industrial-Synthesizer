# Industrial-Synthesizer
A Soundboard of text-to-speech samples of the Nine Inch Nails songs "Only" and "Somewhat Damaged" with instrumental versions of the songs used as backing tracks

26 keys are used for each song, all of them consisting of the lettered keys on the keyboard. The 0 and 1 keys are used to stop and start the backing tracks.

This project was contructed entirely by myself, however all of the assets are intellectual property of Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails, and whatever Record Companies have also laid claim to With Teeth and The Fragile.

I have only tested this project on PC, Windows 10 to be specific, and if loaded from the file: protocol Chrome, IE, and Safari may throw a fit (Chrome is almost guaranteed to give you trouble because of their safety features with loading pages from file)
